# Hello new CSE 15L Students!!

In this tutorial, I'm going to be walking through the steps of installing the IDE VIsual Studio Code to your computer/laptop. I'm currently on a Mac so most of this tutorial is going to be adjusted for people on Mac. I'm also going to be explaining how to log into servers in the basement of the CSE building at UCSD. Specifically, I'm going to be logging into the account ieng6 and remotely connecting to it.

## 1) Installing Visual Studio Code
