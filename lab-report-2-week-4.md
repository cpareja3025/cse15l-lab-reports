# CSE 15L Lab Report #2


In the lab this week we worked on systematic testing, we also worked on committing changes to our code in the file `MarkdownParse.java`. Our team fixed bugs
in our code in order to allow for more inputs in our test files. On this page I'm going to be showing some of the changes that we made to our code as well
descriping the input of our failing induced input. In the end, for each bug that we fixed, I will be giving a brief explanation of the relationship between the
the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.
