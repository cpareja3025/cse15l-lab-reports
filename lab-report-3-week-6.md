# Lab Report 3 Week #6
 > In this weeks Lab Report, I will be explaing the steps to remotely copying the `markdownparse` repository to the ieng6 server at the UCSD CSE basement. I will be walking through the steps of choice #3 from the week 5 lab. In order to do this we need to run certain commands such as `scp -r` to successfully copy the repository.
